# machine-_learning_feature_selection_-_reduction
I developed a machine-learning solution to predict customer churn using structured telecom data. The project involved data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and applying feature-importance analysis to identify key drivers of churn.
I trained multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, and optimized them using hyperparameter tuning.
The final model achieved high accuracy and strong recall, allowing the system to effectively identify at-risk customers. This project strengthened my skills in data preprocessing, model evaluation, feature engineering, and real-world ML deployment workflows.
